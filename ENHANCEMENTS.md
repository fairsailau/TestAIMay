# Enhanced Metadata Processing

This document describes the enhancements made to the metadata extraction and processing functionality in the metadataextractApril application.

## Enhancements Implemented

1. **Document Type Specific Prompts for Freeform Extraction**
   - The application now supports using different prompts for different document types when using freeform extraction
   - Each document type can have its own custom prompt defined in the Metadata Configuration page
   - During processing, the appropriate prompt is automatically selected based on the document type

2. **Structured Template Mapping**
   - The application now properly uses the document type to template mapping when processing files
   - Each document type can be mapped to a specific metadata template in the Metadata Configuration page
   - During processing, the appropriate template is automatically selected based on the document type

3. **Multiple Metadata Configurations**
   - The application now supports applying different metadata configurations to different files in a single processing run
   - Files are processed according to their document type, using the appropriate prompt or template
   - This enables batch processing of mixed document types with optimal extraction settings for each

## How It Works

1. **Document Type Detection**
   - A new `get_document_type_for_file` function determines the document type for each file based on categorization results
   - If a file hasn't been categorized, it falls back to using the general configuration

2. **Freeform Extraction**
   - For freeform extraction, the application checks if there's a specific prompt defined for the document type
   - If found, it uses that prompt; otherwise, it falls back to the general freeform prompt

3. **Structured Extraction**
   - For structured extraction, the application checks if there's a specific template mapped to the document type
   - If found, it uses that template; otherwise, it falls back to the general template

## Testing and Verification

Two test scripts are included to verify the functionality:

1. **test_enhanced_processing.py**
   - Tests document type specific prompts
   - Tests structured template mapping
   - Tests multiple metadata configurations
   - Tests fallback to general configuration when needed

2. **verify_backward_compatibility.py**
   - Verifies that the enhancements don't break existing functionality
   - Tests basic freeform extraction without document categorization
   - Tests structured extraction with template without document categorization
   - Tests structured extraction with custom fields without document categorization
   - Tests processing with feedback data

## User Interface Improvements

The Metadata Configuration page has been enhanced to make it clearer that:
- Document type specific prompts will be used when processing files of the corresponding document type
- Document type to template mappings will be used when processing files of the corresponding document type
- The default template is used for files that don't have a document type or don't have a specific template mapping
